## Notes from the kickoff session

**One-liner.** Predict short-term (intraday) **realized volatility** with a **neural-network** approach, using market data and **news as features**.

---

## Goals
- Focus on **realized volatility (RV)** prediction (intraday / short term).
- You may choose a **cross-sectional (XS)** or **time-series (TS)** framing.
- Free to **choose the stock universe** (and compare types of stocks if useful).

## Data
- **No dataset is provided** â€” we must **source/build the data** ourselves.
- **News inputs** are explicitly in scope as predictive features.

## Approach & Scope
- Take a **neural-network perspective** (not restricted to a single architecture).
- This is **research-oriented**: exploration over a fixed recipe.

## Process & Support
- **Limited predefined guidance**; autonomy expected.
- **Weekly meetings**; ask questions as needed.
